Our mission is to help  travellers for planning their best trip and provide them a good travelling experience. We are working to make their trip hustle free. 
My role in development of this project is as a front - end developer. I have used html and external css for development. I have used pixabey and unsplash websites for All the images that used and for icons I used font awesome library. 
I made use of multiple tags for displaying different types of content like I used form tag for login and registration form, Anchor tag for providing internal links of pages in navigation bar for convinience of user. It is a responsive website so user can access it on any device.CSS properties like background color, border, font- size, media query and many more properties are used to add different styles and make interface attractive. 
It was challenging task for me to develop this website. For reference I visited many websites of popular tourism companies like kesari tours and veena world. I observed their websites in very detailed manner. I also inspected their code  and it helped me a lot to gain understanding about how each tag of html and css properties work.
